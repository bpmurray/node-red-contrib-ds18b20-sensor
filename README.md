# node-red-contrib-ds18b20-sensor
This is a [Node Red](http://nodered.org/) node to manage connection to DS18B20 sensors on a Raspberry Pi. For each sensor found, it returns the msg object where the *topic* is set to the sensor ID and the *payload* is set to the temperature. If the node's topic is set to a device ID, or a device ID is passed into the node as **msg.topic**, this is used to return a single reading for the specified sensor. If the *Array* checkbox is checked or **msg.array** is set to true, the value(s) are returned as an array in **msg.payload**. The current timestamp is always set as **msg.timestamp**.

A simple flow is to click on an *input node* to inject an empty message to the *sensor node* and capture the output in a *debug node*:

Clicking on the *input node* causes the values from all available temperature sensors to be returned as a series of messages:

If the *Array* checkbox is checked this will cause the return of data as an array, i.e. the function of this checkbox is to force a single value into an array:

If you provide an empty topic value, this indicates that you want the data associated with all devices returned. If the array checkbox is selected, they are in a single message as an array in the payload:
```javascript
[ { "family": "28", "id": "71EEFA050000", "file": "28-000005faee71", "temp": 15.062 }, { "family": "28", "id": "8D85FB050000", "file": "28-000005fb858d", "temp": 16.75 }, { "family": "28", "id": "BD27FB050000", "file": "28-000005fb27bd", "temp": 85 }, { "family": "28", "id": "1BE4FA050000", "file": "28-000005fae41b", "temp": 15.812 }, { "family": "28", "id": "678C8B060000", "file": "28-0000068b8c67", "temp": 16.937 } ]
```

However, if the checkbox is not checked, the values are returned as a series of individual messages, one per sensor, where the payload is set to the temperature value. In this case, the topic contains the ID of the sensor:
```javascript
{ "topic": "8D85FB050000", "payload": 16.687, "_msgid": "dd456bcd.22ba98", "timestamp": 1462462207366, "family": "28", "file": "28-000005fb858d" }
```

In both cases, the timestamp of the reading is set in the message.

Now, if the *input node* is clicked again, this time the data are returned as an array:

By default, this node targets DS18B20 sensors, but you can also use it to capture data from other similar sensors. This reads the list of all available sensors using the Dallas One-Wire Protocol, and retrieves the temperature from those sensors that provide a temperature value.

The node is added to the Raspberry Pi section.
